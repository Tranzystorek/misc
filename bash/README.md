# Bash

## List

### [dicethrow.sh](dicethrow.sh)

Simulates a dicethrow, accepts standard RPG syntax ("THROWS d SIDES", e.g. 2d6).

Older bash script version, language completely unadjusted to the purpose :P

### [quine.sh](quine.sh)

A pretty concise quine in shell. Uselessness in its most elegant form.
