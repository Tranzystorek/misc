# Miscellaneous thingies

## About

Here I keep some of the {`funny`, `useful`, `interesting`} utilities and/or thingies
I created. Feel free to use if you want.

## Contents

### [bash/dicethrow.sh](bash/dicethrow.sh) / [python/dicethrow.py](python/dicethrow.py)

Simulates a dicethrow, accepts standard RPG syntax ("THROWS d SIDES", e.g. 2d6).

### [vim/myspacevim.vim](vim/myspacevim.vim)

A SpaceVim bootstrap function that makes files opened in read-only mode
unmodifiable so that you can use vim as a file viewer.

Preferably used with `alias view="vim -R"`.

Zsh function that lists only hidden files (AKA dotfiles) in the given directory.

### [zsh/arch-utils.zsh](zsh/arch-utils.zsh)
