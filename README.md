# Miscellaneous thingies

## About

Here I keep some of the {`funny`, `useful`, `interesting`} utilities and/or thingies
I created. Feel free to use if you want.

Important config files that I use everyday have been migrated
to the [dotfiles](https://github.com/tranzystorek-io/dotfiles) repo.

## Contents

### bash

Bash (or POSIX sh) utilities.

### python

Python utilities.

### vim

Vimscripts of various sorts.

### zsh

Zsh utilities. Highly unlikely to be compatible with Bash.
